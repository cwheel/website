			"description": "In the late spring of 2015, I made it out Grand Teton National Park. At the recommendation of a parks employee, I paid a visit to Hanging Canyon - a beautiful glacial canyon overlooking lake Jenny. A large amount of snow was left on the upper portion of the route, making it a great spring alpine ascent. I made it up to the actual canyon in around three hours but decided to cut my stay short. I had originally planned on climbing up to the Jaw (the official end of Hanging Canyon), but left prematurely due to deteriorating snow conditions and a short timeline for the day."
