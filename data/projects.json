		 	"description"  : "Wellness for the ones you care about, in a beautiful and elegant web app. Familee, I and my teammates HackUMass 2015 submission, pulls data from connected Fitbit devices to keep relatives, care givers and family members informed about their older loved ones health. Familee looks at time spent walking, sleeping, and heard rate each day. Familee also attempts to infer when a love one is sick by combining all three data points into one, a 'sickness score'. Additionally, Familee uses Twilio to send text message alerts when it senses troubling health statistics. To top it off, Familee also supports texting medication reminders at pre determined times during the day."
